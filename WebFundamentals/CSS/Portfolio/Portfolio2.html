                        <p>
                            Hello I'm an extremely driven and creative Full Stack Developer who is currently open for carreer opportunities as a front-end or back-end web developer in the Greater Seattle Area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm a recent graduate of Coding Dojo, a coding school located in Bellevue, Washington that teaches 3 full stacks in three months. I'm capable of learning new technologies very quickly, and am always looking for opportunities to further expand my skills and grows as a developer.
