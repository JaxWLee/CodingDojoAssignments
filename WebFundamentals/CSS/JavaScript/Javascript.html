                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented, scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexability for developers to take it in a bunch of directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide a programmatic control over them.

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, the variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers <div id="list">var x;</div></li>
                    <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment opperators assign values to the JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured into it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment opperator assigns a value to the variable <div id="list">var = 10;</div> </li>
                    <li><a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to opperate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean <div id="list">true</div>or <div id="list">false;</div> null - aka nothing; Number - <div id="list">42</div> or <div id="list">3.14159;</div> String - <div id="list">"Coding Dojo Rocks";</div> Array - <div id="list">[1,'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</div> and Object - <div id="list">{first_name='Jane',last_name='Doe'}.</div></li>
                    <li><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on different values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <div id="list">if</div> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <div id="list">else if</div> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <div id="list">else</div> we execute this block of code.</li>
                    <li><a href="">Loops</a> there are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they essentially do the same thing: they repeat some action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around this track four times and then you stop. That is a loop!</li>
                    <li><a href="">Functions</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top,next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
